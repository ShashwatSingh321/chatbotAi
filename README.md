# Chatbot Using Gemini API

This README file provides an overview of the chatbot project you created using the Gemini API. It includes installation instructions, setup details, and how to run the chatbot.

---

## Project Overview

This chatbot utilizes the Gemini API to deliver intelligent responses to user queries. It is designed for seamless integration into applications and provides features such as natural language understanding, context retention, and flexible deployment options.

---

## Features

- **Natural Language Processing**: Understands user input and generates context-aware responses.
- **API Integration**: Leverages the Gemini API for advanced conversational capabilities.
- **Customizable**: Easily modifiable for specific use cases.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal dependencies for smooth deployment.

---

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the chatbot, ensure you have the following:

1. Node.js (16.x or later)
2. Access to the Gemini API (API key required)
3. Basic knowledge of JavaScript, React, and Node.js

---

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the chatbot:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

2. **Install Backend Dependencies**
   Navigate to the backend directory and install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Install Frontend Dependencies**
   Navigate to the frontend directory and install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. **Configure API Access**
   Create a `.env` file in the backend directory and add your Gemini API key:
   ```env
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

---

## Running the Chatbot

1. **Start the Backend Server**
   Navigate to the backend directory and run:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Start the Frontend Application**
   Navigate to the frontend directory and run:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. The chatbot will be accessible through the frontend interface. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Customization

You can customize the chatbot's behavior by modifying the backend logic in `server.js` or the frontend components in the `src/` directory. For example:

- Add new API routes in the backend
- Enhance the user interface in the React components
- Connect additional services (e.g., databases, third-party APIs)

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Invalid API Key**: Ensure the API key in your `.env` file is correct.
- **Dependency Errors**: Run `npm install` in both the backend and frontend directories to reinstall dependencies.
- **Connection Issues**: Check your internet connection and ensure the Gemini API service is operational.

---

## Future Enhancements

- Add support for multiple languages
- Improve error handling
- Integrate with external services (e.g., Slack, WhatsApp)
